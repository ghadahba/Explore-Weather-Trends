# Explore-Weather-Trends
This is the first project in the Data Analyst Nanodegree by Udacity.

Getting Started
In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

Instructions
The main goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.

Information about this project:
- The tools used in this project is Microsoft Excel 2019.
- In this project, I will compare the temperature in Mecca in Saudi Arabia to the global temperature from 1861 and to the year 2013
- The Databases :
city_list: Contains a list of cities and countries in the database. 
city_data: Contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
global_data: Contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).
mecca: Contains the average temperatures for Mecca by year(ºC).

The Steps:
1. Extract the data from the database.
2. Make observations
- linear plot for average temperature in Mecca and global.
- The moving average for 10 years for each of the average temperatures for Mecca and global and the trendline.
- Some statistical functions to see the difference and similarity for average temperatures for Mecca and global.
- The forecasting for the next 10 years is the average temperature for both Mecca and the global.
