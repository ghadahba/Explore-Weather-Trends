# Explore-Weather-Trends
This is the first project in the Data Analyst Nanodegree by Udacity.

## Getting Started
In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

## Instructions
The main goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.

## Information about this project:
- The tools used in this project is Microsoft Excel 2019.
- In this project, I will compare the temperature in Mecca in Saudi Arabia to the global temperature from 1861 and to the year 2013
- The Databases :
city_list: Contains a list of cities and countries in the database. 
city_data: Contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
global_data: Contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).
mecca: Contains the average temperatures for Mecca by year(ºC).

## The Steps:
1. Extract the data from the database.
2. Make observations
- linear plot for average temperature in Mecca and global.
- The moving average for 10 years for each of the average temperatures for Mecca and global and the trendline.
- Some statistical functions to see the difference and similarity for average temperatures for Mecca and global.
- The forecasting for the next 10 years is the average temperature for both Mecca and the global.
